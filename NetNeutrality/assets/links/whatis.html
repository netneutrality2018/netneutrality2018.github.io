<h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
<h2>What Is Net Neutrality?</h2>
<p>You have heard of it before, but what in the world is it? Net neutrality is the basic principle that protects our free speech on the Internet. "Title II" of the Communications Act is what provides the legal foundation for net neutrality and prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from slowing down and blocking websites, or charging apps and sites extra fees to reach an audience (which they then pass along to consumers.) The Internet has thrived precisely because of net neutrality. It's what makes it so vibrant and innovativeâ€”a place for creativity, free expression, and exchange of ideas. Without net neutrality, the Internet will become more like Cable TV, where the content you see is what your provider puts in front of you.</p>
