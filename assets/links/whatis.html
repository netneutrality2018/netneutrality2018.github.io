<h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
<h2>What Is Net Neutrality?</h2>
<p>You have heard of it before, but what in the world is it? Net neutrality is wihat protects our free speech on the Internet. "Title II" of the Communications Act is what provides the legal basis for net neutrality and prevents ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and ATT from slowing down or blocking websites, or charging fees to reach certain sites. The Internet has grown immensely because of net neutrality. It's why the internet is so vibrant and innovative, its a place for creativity, free expression, and freedom of all ideas. Without net neutrality, the Internet will become more like Cable TV, where the content you see is what your provider chooses for you to see.</p>
