<h2>Why Do We Need Net Neutrality?</h2>
<p>Without net neutrality internet service providers could limit your speeds when connecting to opposing companies websites, sometimes so slow it becomes unusable, therefore encouraging customers t.o use said companies products instead or pay a hefty fee to restore full access. Many ISP's have even admitted that without net neutrality they would create such fees. For example they could have a "social media" pcakage which allows you to have full speed to sites such as FaceBook, Twitter, YouTube etc. Without paying that however, you would have extremely slow speeds connnecting to said sites.</p>
